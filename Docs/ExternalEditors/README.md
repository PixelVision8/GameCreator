# External Editors

The Game Creator was designed to operate in conjunction with your favorite external graphic and code editors. While there are tools built into the Game Creator, they were primarily designed to help debug and configure the engine, not create new content. With that in mind, the Game Creator is flexible enough to adapt its workflow to how you like to work.
