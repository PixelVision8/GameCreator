# Complete Lua API

This is a complete list of Pixel Vision 8â€™s Lua APIs. Some of these methods may contain optional arguments allowing you to provide only the values you need. Be sure to read the description to understand how each method is used. While the engine itself contains lots of separate system working together, only a small subset of these are exposed to the Lua API. Additional APIs can be accessed through other bridges which are automatically loaded by each chip.

## Lifecycle
### Draw (  )
#### Summary
 Draw() is called once per frame after the Update() has completed. This is where all visual updates to your game should take place such as clearing the display, drawing sprites, and pushing raw pixel data into the display. 

---
### Reset (  )
#### Summary
 Reset() is called when a game is restarted. This is usually called instead of reloading the entire game. It allows you to perform additional configuration that would not be able to happen if the Init() method is not called. This is mostly ignored in the Runner and is mainly used in the Game Creator. 

---
### Shutdown (  )
#### Summary
 Shutdown() is called when quitting a game or shutting down the Runner/Game Creator. This hook allows you to perform any last minute changes to the game's data such as saving or removing any temp files that will not be needed. 

---

## Color
### BackgroundColor ( id )
#### Summary
 The background color is used to fill the screen when clearing the display. You can use this method to read or update the background color at any point during the GameChip's draw phase. When calling BackgroundColor(), without an argument, it returns the current background color int. You can pass in an optional int to update the background color by calling BackgroundColor(0) where 0 is any valid ID in the ColorChip. Passing in a value such as -1, or one that is out of range, defaults the background color to magenta (#ff00ff) which is the engine's default transparent color. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | int? |  This argument is optional. Supply an int to update the existing background color value.  |

#### Returns
 This method returns the current background color ID. If no color exists, it returns -1 which is magenta (#FF00FF). 

---
### Color ( id, value )
#### Summary
 The Color() method allows you to read and update color values in the ColorChip. This method has two modes which require a color ID to work. By calling the method with just an ID, like Color(0), it returns a hex string for the given color at the supplied color ID. By passing in a new hex string, like Color(0, "#FFFF00"), you can change the color with the given ID. While you can use this method to modify color values directly, you should avoid doing this at run time since the DisplayChip must parse and cache the new hex value. If you just want to change a color to an existing value, use the ReplaceColor() method. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | int |  The ID of the color you want to access.  |
| value | string |  This argument is optional. It accepts a hex as a string and updates the supplied color ID's value.  |

#### Returns
 This method returns a hex string for the supplied color ID. If the color has not been set or is out of range, it returns magenta (#FF00FF) which is the default transparent system color. 

---
### ColorsPerSprite (  )
#### Summary
 Pixel Vision 8 sprites have limits around how many colors they can display at once which is called the Colors Per Sprite or CPS. The ColorsPerSprite() method returns this value from the SpriteChip. While this is read-only at run-time, it has other important uses. If you set up your ColorChip in palettes, grouping sets of colors together based on the SpriteChip's CPS value, you can use this to shift a sprite's color offset up or down by a fixed amount when drawing it to the display. Since this value does not change when a game is running, it is best to get a reference to it when the game starts up and store it in a local variable. 

---
### ReplaceColor ( index, id )
#### Summary
 The ReplaceColor() method allows you to quickly change a color to an existing color without triggering the DisplayChip to parse and cache a new hex value. Consider this an alternative to the Color() method. It is useful for simulating palette swapping animation on sprites pointed to a fixed group of color IDs. Simply cal the ReplaceColor() method and supply a target color ID position, then the new color ID it should point to. Since you are only changing the color's ID pointer, there is little to no performance penalty during the GameChip's draw phase. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| index | int | The ID of the color you want to change. |
| id | int | The ID of the color you want to replace it with. |


---
### TotalColors ( ignoreEmpty )
#### Summary
 The TotalColors() method simply returns the total number of colors in the ColorChip. By default, it returns only colors that have been set to value other than magenta (#FF00FF) which is the default transparent value used by the engine. By calling TotalColors(false), it returns the total available color slots in the ColorChip. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| ignoreEmpty | bool |  This is an optional value that defaults to true. When set to true, the ColorChip returns the total number of colors not set to magenta (#FF00FF). Set this value to false if you want to get all of the available color slots in the ColorChip regardless if they are empty or not.  |

#### Returns
 This method returns the total number of colors in the color chip based on the ignoreEmpty argument's value. 

---

## Display
### Clear ( x, y, width, height )
#### Summary
 Clearing the display removed all of the existing pixel data, replacing it with the default background color. The Clear() method allows you specify what region of the display to clear. By simply calling Clear(), with no arguments, it automatically clears the entire display. You can manually define an area of the screen to clear by supplying option x, y, width and height arguments. When clearing a specific area of the display, anything outside of the defined boundaries remains on the next draw phase. This is useful for drawing a HUD but clearing the display below for a scrolling map and sprites. Clear can only be used once during the draw phase. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| x | int |  This is an optional value that defaults to 0 and defines where the clear's X position should begin. When X is 0, clear starts on the far left-hand side of the display. Values less than 0 or greater than the width of the display are ignored.  |
| y | int |  This is an optional value that defaults to 0 and defines where the clear's Y position should begin. When Y is 0, clear starts at the top of the display. Values less than 0 or greater than the height of the display are ignored.  |
| width | int? |  This is an optional value that defaults to the width of the display and defines how many horizontal pixels to clear. When the width is 0, clear starts at the x position and ends at the far right-hand side of the display. Values less than 0 or greater than the width are adjusted to stay within the boundaries of the screen's visible pixels.  |
| height | int? |  This is an optional value that defaults to the height of the display and defines how many vertical pixels to clear. When the height is 0, clear starts at the Y position and ends at the bottom of the display. Values less than 0 or greater than the height are adjusted to stay within the boundaries of the screen's visible pixels.  |


---
### Display ( visible )
#### Summary
 The display's size defines the visible area where pixel data exists on the screen. Calculating this is important for knowing how to position sprites on the screen. The Display() method allows you to get the resolution of the display at run time. By default, this will return the visble screen area based on the overscan value set on the display chip. To calculate the exact overscan in pixels, you must subtract the full size from the visible size. Simply supply false as an argument to get the full display dimensions. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| visible | bool |  |


---
### DrawPixel ( x, y, colorRef, drawMode )
#### Summary
 This method allows you to draw a single pixel to the Tilemap Cache. It's an expensive operation which leverages DrawPixels(). This should only be used in special occasions when batching pixel data draw request aren't possible. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| x | int |  The x position where to display the new pixel data. The display's horizontal 0 position is on the far left-hand side. When using DrawMode.TilemapCache, the pixel data is drawn into the tilemap's cache instead of directly on the display when using DrawMode.Sprite.  |
| y | int |  The Y position where to display the new pixel data. The display's vertical 0 position is on the top. When using DrawMode.TilemapCache, the pixel data is drawn into the tilemap's cache instead of directly on the display when using DrawMode.Sprite.  |
| colorRef | int |  The color ID to use when drawing the pixel.  |
| drawMode | DrawMode |  This argument only accepts the DrawMode.TilemapCache enum.  |


---
### DrawPixels ( pixelData, x, y, width, height, drawMode, flipH, flipV, colorOffset )
#### Summary
 This method allows you to draw raw pixel data directly to the display. Depending on which draw mode you use, the pixel data could be rendered as a sprite or drawn directly onto the tilemap cache. Sprites drawn with this method still count against the total number the display can render but you can draw irregularly shaped sprites by defining a custom width and height. For drawnig into the tilemap cache directly, you can use this to change the way the tilemap looks at run-time without having to modify a sprite's pixel data. It is important to note that when you change a tile's sprite ID or color offset, the tilemap redraws it back to the cache overwriting any pixel data that was previously there. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pixelData | int[] |  The pixelData argument accepts an int array representing references to color IDs. The pixelData array length needs to be the same size as the supplied width and height, or it will throw an error.  |
| x | int |  The x position where to display the new pixel data. The display's horizontal 0 position is on the far left-hand side. When using DrawMode.TilemapCache, the pixel data is drawn into the tilemap's cache instead of directly on the display when using DrawMode.Sprite.  |
| y | int |  The Y position where to display the new pixel data. The display's vertical 0 position is on the top. When using DrawMode.TilemapCache, the pixel data is drawn into the tilemap's cache instead of directly on the display when using DrawMode.Sprite.  |
| width | int |  The width of the pixel data to use when rendering to the display.  |
| height | int |  The height of the pixel data to use when rendering to the display.  |
| drawMode | DrawMode |  This argument accepts the DrawMode enum. You can use Sprite, SpriteBelow, and TilemapCache to change where the pixel data is drawn to. By default, this value is DrawMode.Sprite.  |
| flipH | bool |  This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data horizontally.  |
| flipV | bool |  This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data vertically.  |
| colorOffset | int |  This optional argument accepts an int that offsets all the color IDs in the pixel data array. This value is added to each int, in the pixel data array, allowing you to simulate palette shifting.  |


---
### DrawRect ( x, y, width, height, color, drawMode )
#### Summary
 This method allows you to draw a rectangle with a fill color. By default, this method is used to clear the screen but you can supply a color offset to change the color value and use it to fill a rectangle area with a specific color instead. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| x | int |  |
| y | int |  |
| width | int |  |
| height | int |  |
| color | int |  |
| drawMode | DrawMode |  |


---
### DrawSprite ( id, x, y, flipH, flipV, drawMode, colorOffset )
#### Summary
 Sprites represent individual collections of pixel data at a fixed size. By default, Pixel Vision 8 sprites are 8 x 8 pixels and have a set limit of visible colors. You can use the DrawSprite() method to render any sprite stored in the Sprite Chip. The display also has a limitation on how many sprites can be on the screen at one time. Each time you call DrawSprite(), the sprite counts against the total amount the display can render. If you attempt to draw more sprites than the display can handle, the call is ignored. One thing to keep in mind when drawing sprites is that their x and y position wraps if they reach the right or bottom border of the screen. You need to change the overscan border to hide sprites offscreen. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | int |  The unique ID of the sprite to use in the SpriteChip.  |
| x | int |  An int value representing the X position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the far left-hand side of the screen.  |
| y | int |  An int value representing the Y position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the top of the screen.  |
| flipH | bool |  This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data horizontally.  |
| flipV | bool |  This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data vertically.  |
| drawMode | DrawMode |  |
| colorOffset | int |  This optional argument accepts an int that offsets all the color IDs in the pixel data array. This value is added to each int, in the pixel data array, allowing you to simulate palette shifting.  |

### DrawSpriteBlock ( id, x, y, width, height, flipH, flipV, drawMode, colorOffset, onScreen, useScrollPos )
#### Summary
 DrawSpriteBlock() is similar to DrawSprites except you define the first sprite (upper left corner) and the width x height (in sprites) to sample from sprite ram. This will create a larger sprite by using neighbor sprites. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | int | The top left sprite to start with.  |
| x | int |  An int value representing the X position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the far left-hand side of the screen.  |
| y | int |  An int value representing the Y position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the top of the screen.  |
| width | int |  The width, in sprites, of the grid. A value of 2 renders 2 sprites wide. The DrawSprites method continues to run through all of the sprites in the ID array until reaching the end. Sprite groups do not have to be perfect squares since the width value is only used to wrap sprites to the next row.  |
| height | int |  |
| flipH | bool |  This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data horizontally.  |
| flipV | bool |  This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data vertically.  |
| drawMode | DrawMode |  |
| colorOffset | int |  This optional argument accepts an int that offsets all the color IDs in the pixel data array. This value is added to each int, in the pixel data array, allowing you to simulate palette shifting.  |
| onScreen | bool |  This flag defines if the sprites should not render when they are off the screen. Use this in conjunction with overscan border control what happens to sprites at the edge of the display. If this value is false, the sprites wrap around the screen when they reach the edges of the screen.  |
| useScrollPos | bool | This will automatically offset the sprite's x and y position based on the scroll value. |


---
### DrawSprites ( ids, x, y, width, flipH, flipV, drawMode, colorOffset, onScreen, useScrollPos, bounds )
#### Summary
 The DrawSprites method makes it easier to combine and draw groups of sprites to the display in a grid. This is useful when trying to render 4 sprites together as a larger 16x16 pixel graphic. While there is no limit on the size of the sprite group which can be rendered, it is important to note that each sprite in the array still counts as an individual sprite. Sprites passed into the DrawSprites() method are visible if the display can render it. Under the hood, this method uses DrawSprite but solely manages positioning the sprites out in a grid. Another unique feature of his helper method is that it automatically hides sprites that go offscreen. When used with overscan border, it greatly simplifies drawing larger sprites to the display. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| ids | int[] |  An array of sprite IDs to display on the screen.  |
| x | int |  An int value representing the X position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the far left-hand side of the screen.  |
| y | int |  An int value representing the Y position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the top of the screen.  |
| width | int |  The width, in sprites, of the grid. A value of 2 renders 2 sprites wide. The DrawSprites method continues to run through all of the sprites in the ID array until reaching the end. Sprite groups do not have to be perfect squares since the width value is only used to wrap sprites to the next row.  |
| flipH | bool |  This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data horizontally.  |
| flipV | bool |  This is an optional argument which accepts a bool. The default value is set to false but passing in true flips the pixel data vertically.  |
| drawMode | DrawMode |  |
| colorOffset | int |  This optional argument accepts an int that offsets all the color IDs in the pixel data array. This value is added to each int, in the pixel data array, allowing you to simulate palette shifting.  |
| onScreen | bool |  This flag defines if the sprites should not render when they are off the screen. Use this in conjunction with overscan border control what happens to sprites at the edge of the display. If this value is false, the sprites wrap around the screen when they reach the edges of the screen.  |
| useScrollPos | bool | This will automatically offset the sprite's x and y position based on the scroll value. |
| bounds | Rect |  |


---
### DrawText ( text, x, y, drawMode, font, colorOffset, spacing )
#### Summary
 The DrawText() method allows you to render text to the display. By supplying a custom DrawMode, you can render characters as individual sprites (DrawMode.Sprite), tiles (DrawMode.Tile) or drawn directly into the tilemap cache (DrawMode.TilemapCache). When drawing text as sprites, you have more flexibility over position, but each character counts against the displays' maximum sprite count. When rendering text to the tilemap, more characters are shown and also increase performance when rendering large amounts of text. You can also define the color offset, letter spacing which only works for sprite and tilemap cache rendering, and a width in characters if you want the text to wrap. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| text | string |  A text string to display on the screen.  |
| x | int |  An int value representing the X position to start the text on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the far left-hand side of the screen.  |
| y | int |  An int value representing the Y position to place sprite on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the top of the screen.  |
| drawMode | DrawMode |  This argument accepts the DrawMode enum. You can use Sprite, SpriteBelow, and TilemapCache to change where the pixel data is drawn to. By default, this value is DrawMode.Sprite.  |
| font | string |  The name of the font to use. You do not need to add the font's file extension. If the file is called The name of the font to use. You do not need to add the font's file extension. If the file is called default.font.png, you can simply refer to it as "default" when supplying an argument value.  |
| colorOffset | int |  This optional argument accepts an int that offsets all the color IDs in the pixel data array. This value is added to each color ID in the font's pixel data, allowing you to simulate palette shifting.  |
| spacing | int |  This optional argument sets the number of pixels between each character when rendering text. This value is ignored when rendering text as tiles. This value can be positive or negative depending on your needs. By default, it is 0.  |


---
### DrawTile ( id, c, r, drawMode, colorOffset )
#### Summary
 The DrawTile method makes it easier to update the visuals of a tile on any of the map layers. By default, this will modify a single tile's sprite id and color offset. You can also define the DrawMode to target a specific layer. By default, DrawMode.Tile is used, but this method also accepts DrawMode.TilemapCache and DrawMode.UI to target the UI layer above the tilemap. It's important to note that this method can only draw a tile at a specific column and row. If you need pixel perfect drawing on the TilemapCache or UI layer, use the DrawPixels method. Finally, drawing a tile into the tilemap itself will force that tile to be copied to the Tilemap Cache on the next render pass just like calling the Tile() method. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | int | Sprite ID to use for the tile. |
| c | int | The column in the layer. |
| r | int | The row in the layer. |
| drawMode | DrawMode | This accepts DrawMode.Tile, DrawMode.TilemapCache and DrawMode.UI. |
| colorOffset | int | This is the color offset to use for the tile. |


---
### DrawTilemap ( x, y, columns, rows, offsetX, offsetY, drawMode )
#### Summary
 By default, the tilemap renders to the display by simply calling DrawTilemap(). This automatically fills the entire display with the visible portion of the tilemap. To have more granular control over how to render the tilemap, you can supply an optional X and Y position to change where it draws on the screen. You can also modify the width (columns) and height (rows) that are displayed too. This is useful if you want to show a HUD or some other kind of image on the screen that is not overridden by the tilemap. To scroll the tilemap, you need to call the ScrollPosition() and supply a new scroll X and Y value. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| x | int |  An optional int value representing the X position to render the tilemap on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the far left-hand side of the screen.  |
| y | int |  An optional int value representing the Y position to render the tilemap on the display. If set to 0, it renders on the top of the screen.  |
| columns | int |  An optional int value representing how many horizontal tiles to include when drawing the map. By default, this is 0 which automatically uses the full visible width of the display, while taking into account the X position offset.  |
| rows | int |  An optional int value representing how many vertical tiles to include when drawing the map. By default, this is 0 which automatically uses the full visible height of the display, while taking into account the Y position offset.  |
| offsetX | int? |  An optional int value to override the scroll X position. This is useful when you need to change the left x position from where to sample the tilemap data from.  |
| offsetY | int? |  An optional int value to override the scroll Y position. This is useful when you need to change the top y position from where to sample the tilemap data from.  |
| drawMode | DrawMode |  |


---
### DrawTiles ( ids, c, r, width, drawMode, colorOffset )
#### Summary
 The DrawTiles method makes it easier to update the visuals of multiple tiles at once by leveraging the DrawTile method. Simply pass in an Array of sprite IDs, the column, row and width (in tiles) to make bulk changes to a tilemap layer. You can also define the DrawMode to target a specific layer. By default, DrawMode.Tile is used, but this method also accepts DrawMode.TilemapCache and DrawMode.UI to target the UI layer above the tilemap. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| ids | int[] | An Array of Sprite IDs. |
| c | int | The column in the layer. |
| r | int | The row in the layer. |
| width | int | The number of horizontal tiles in the group. |

---
### ScrollPosition ( x, y )
#### Summary
 You can scroll the tilemap by calling the ScrollPosition() method and supplying a new scroll X and Y position. By default, calling ScrollPosition() with no arguments returns a vector with the current scroll X and Y values. If you supply an X and Y value, it updates the tilemap's scroll position the next time you call the DrawTilemap() method. 
#### Arguments
| Name | Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| x | int? |  An optional int value representing the scroll X position of the tilemap. If set to 0, it starts on the far left-hand side of the tilemap.  |
