# Code Migration Guide

From time to time, the underlying Pixel Vision API may change. This page documents those changes based on the version of the SDK. While we try not to introduce changes that break existing games or throw errors intentionally, it is best to check this page after a new release to understand how to migrate your code to a new version of the Game Creator.

## Game Creator v0.7.6a API Changes 

Pixel Vision Game Creator leverages version v1.7.6 of the open source Pixel Vision SDK. Here is a quick list of code APIs that have changed and require updating  in your game:

* `DrawSprite` now requires a DrawMode (DrawMode.Sprite/DrawMode.SpriteAbove or DrawMode.SpriteBelow) instead of a bool for defining to render above or below the tilemap layer.

* `DrawSprites` also requires DrawMode instead of a bool to render the sprites above or below the tilemap.

## Game Creator v0.7.0a API Changes 

Pixel Vision Game Creator leverages version v1.4 of the open source Pixel Vision SDK. Here is a quick list of code APIs that have changed and require updating  in your game:

* `ScreenBufferChip `is no longer part of the SDK. Remove any references to it in your code.

* `RebuildScreenBuffer()` has been deprecated and is no longer a valid API. Calling it will not throw an error but it does nothing.

* `ToggleDisplayWrap()` has been deprecated and is now set to true automatically. If you are looking to have sprites offscreen, set the overscan property on the `DisplayChip`.

The biggest change in v0.7.0a is that you no longer have to use the API Bridge to call core engine APIs. All new APIs are global, so they can be accessed anywhere in a gameâ€™s lua code. For example:

`apiBridge:DrawSprite(0, 10, 10)`

Is now

`DrawSprite(0, 10, 10)`
