# New Game Tool

The New Game Tool is designed to simplify creating new projects. It’s located in the Workspace/Tools directory. It presents a set of 5 built-in system templates and automatically copies the contents of them over to the Workspace’s Game folder when you select the New Game button.

Each system template was designed specifically around classic game system’s limitations. Simply select a system you want to use which updates the system spec preview below:

Whether you choose a system template from the New Game Tool or the Workspace Explorer Tool, the action will overwrite the contents of the Sandbox directory with a copy of the selected template. Any changes you make to the newly created game only affect it and not the source template. The new game's name is "Untitled_Game" and when you save, it creates a new .pv8 file independent from the original template. You can also design your own system templates, but will only show up inside of the Workspace/Games directory. The System directory is reserved for built-in templates only.
