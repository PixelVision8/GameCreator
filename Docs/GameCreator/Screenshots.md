# Taking Screenshots

The Game Creator has a built-in keyboard shortcut for taking screenshots. You can take a screenshot of anything on the screen by pressing `Ctrl + 2`. Here is a screenshot from the tilemap demo.

When you press `Ctrl + 2`, your screenshot shows up in a new folder inside of the Workspace called Screenshots.

The Game Creator saves screenshots at the visible resolution of the display. In the case of the Tilemap Demo, the screenshot is 152 x 136. While the native resolution of the display is set to 160 x 144, there is an 8 pixel right and bottom overscan offset that is automatically cropped out. This ensures that when you take a screenshot, you do not accidentally capture any graphics or glitches that appear offscreen past the overscan border.
