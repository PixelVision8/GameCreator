The Archive is where the Game Creator stores finished games, tools, and systems. The Game folder is for any game the engine is currently running, or you are editing. This directory is persistent and only replaced when you load a new game. Since this folder is persistent, you to continue working on a game across different sessions. The Lib folder contains Lua scripts shared across different games or tools. Trash contains files that ready to be deleted. By default, the Game Creator empties the trash when you exit.

You can override the default system path by pasting in the path where you want to store your workspace on your computer. Game Creator confirms that the path is valid before creating the new Workspace folder along with all the required projects. Contents inside of the Game, Lib or Trash folder are not copied over when creating a new workspace.
