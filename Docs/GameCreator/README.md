# Using The Game Creator 

The focus of the [Game Creator](https://pixelvision8.itch.io/game-creator) is to streamline building and debugging Pixel Vision 8 games. The Game Creator leverages a unique workflow allowing you to use built-in tools as well as external editors to create authentic 8-bit games. Also, the Game Creator is fully extendable, allowing you to build custom tools on top of easy to use Lua Editor APIs. 

Because of this hybrid approach, you can still use all of the tools you are comfortable with like Photoshop, Aseprite, Sublime Text and more to quickly build games while leveraging the built-in tools to make sure everything is working correctly. This unique workflow is possible thanks to the way that Game Creator leverages its Workspace. The Workspace allows you to work on game files while they are running in the editor, then refresh the game to preview the changes.

Once you understand how to use Game Creator's Workspace, you can dramatically speed up your Pixel Vision 8 game creation while taking advantage of modern editors and workflows.
